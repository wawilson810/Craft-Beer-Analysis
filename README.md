# Project-3-Craft-Beer-Analysis

Before running the python code, please download the csv file from the following link. This csv file was too large to upload into the Github repository so we are including the link to download the csv file into this Readme file so it can be downloaded so the code can be run.

There is a powerpoint file in the main repository, figures and csv files Resources. We have included the schema to send the data from Python to PostgresSQL. We have included our Javascript file in the static/js folder and the html file in the templates folder.

Our team has analyzed craft beer trends within the United States.

Team Members: Derek Mast, Walter Wilson, Anthony Davey, Rolly Costillas

Project Description/Outline
-By looking at one dataset from kaggle and webscraping the BeerAdvocate website, we were able to create a webpage that showed three different visualizations on the craft beer trends in the United States.

  1. One visualization was created to show the states with the most breweries. This barchart was created to include the top twenty states with the most breweries.
  2. Another visualization was created as an interactive dropdown to show the top rated styles of beer by state. This information included is for the top ten beer styles in each state. On the webpage, you are able to click on the dropdown to change the states to get updated information for the beer styles.
  3. The third visualization was created to show, in a bubble chart, the ratings distribution by region. The states were grouped into regions and this visualization was created to also include a dropdown to be able to switch between the different regions of the United States to get updated information.


Datasets to be Used
